    <p>Also known as Mr. Peebles. It basically merged human and cat face, then used Revive app to make it sing to the song.</p>
    <p>Looks very uncanny but funny at the same time.</p>
    <p> The original "Monday left me broken" meme was uploaded by a TikToker named <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beast_warrior?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc">@beast_warrior</a> in late February of this year. It's currently unknown where both the cat head and the human body were sourced from. In turn, @beast_warrior is the creator of both (KnowYourMeme). </p>
    <p> The song affiliated with this meme is Waiting For Love by Avicii. <a href="https://youtu.be/cHHLHGNpCSA"> Listen to the song here if you are still waiting for love (or not idc). </a> </p>
