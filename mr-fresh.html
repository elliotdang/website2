    <p> Mr. Fresh, also known as the Side Eye Cat, refers to an orange cat who makes frequent appearances on the Cat Feeder Camera livestream on the Chinese app Hello Street Cat. The cat is nicknamed Mr. Fresh because he stares at the camera and waits for the viewer to dispense fresh food to eat.</p>
    <p>UPDATE: it is believed that he has been adopted so he won't no longer be a strayed cat and get beaten by bad people.</p>
    <p> Will only eat fresh food, if the food sits for more than 5 seconds he won't eat it (not checked). </p>
    <p> Will judge you (probably). </p>
    <p> Bombastic side eye. </p>
    <p> Gone viral for his attitude. </p>
    <p> Be like Mr. Fresh. </p>
