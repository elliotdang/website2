    <p>She looks very amazed at something and goes 0o0.</p>
    <p>Also called the Shocked Cat, her name is Chocolate, she became famous for her expression on a Japanese community site called 
        2channel in 2010. The reason behind the amazed expression was due to a dislocated jaw and the owner was asking for help on treating the cat.</p>
