    <p>The meme became famous when it showed a woman seeming to yelling and pointing at a cat with a smudged look on its face, hence the name Smudge the Cat, also known as Table Cat. It is believed that heâ€™s from Ottawa, Ontario and hates salad. </p>
    <p>He just randomly hopped on a table, with a salad plate in front of his face, then someone snapped a picture and boom, we got the viral meme.</p>
